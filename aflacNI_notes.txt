You will need to install Android Studio
Follow setup here: https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/android
(stop after creating an Android emulator)

Break until 10:20

permission issue around SSL certificates

npm install -g @angular/cli
in a suitable command window (e.g. in our webtech folder)
ng new basics
then 'y' and enter a few times until you see 'CREATING....'
take a brief look around the 'basics' folder, especially inside 'app'
(NB need to be using terminal window, seems to work better)

	native Android uses Java and is hard
	native iOS uses Swift/Objective C and is hard
	or
	take html, css and js => to native code
	phonegap (no longer with us)
	cordova (really easy)
>>>>>>>>capacitor (even easier)
	Xamarin (pretty easy)
> the arch, swapiTD and myionic projects are ALL zipped in the repo
> for Android (Windows, Linux or Mac is fine)
> for iOS (must be using an Apple Mac with XCode)
> lab time
  develop your project - use documentation, my apps (swapi), your apps
  - nice form fields with validation (think UI/UX)
  - user stories and flow charts
  - make sure your http-get etc. have error handling
  - maybe try debounce for the form inputs
  - show the returned data in a nice way
  - consider architecture - develop a class for your API data?
  - an Ionic version of the project
> 4:30 is show time

- more lab time

- resolve http POST problem
  - making POST requests causes a CORS error
  - solution: pass a header specifying localhost:4200
  - see 'arch' project in repo - 'api-service' and 'contact' component

- an ionic camera example is here: https://github.com/ionic-team/tutorial-photo-gallery-angular

Friday
- A brief 'stand-up' after lunch
  - where you're at
  - what you aim to do
- recommend code freeze by (say) mid afternoon
- preso will be Monday 9:00
- if any team would like to dry run their preso let me know
  - 2:00 team Alobayo (?!?)
  - 2:30 ....
  - 3:30 team Marbled << can Team MARBLED please make their way to the preso room at 3:30 and join the OTHER webex call
                         (link in chat)

- Can I suggest you try to make a MOBILE version of your code
- my 'arch' project is now up in the repo (as arch.zip)
  - includes 'api.service.ts' with sample code for Nicks and one other end-point working

- there was  a question related to custom pipe for 'health...'
- any chance to see your repo? Ah-got it


- angular vs Ionic
  - you have an Angular proj
  - you need a SEPARATE Ionic proj
  - it is possible to copy code from Angualr to Ionic, once you have the projects


Some ignorable suggestions for presentations:
- avoid dense slides - talk don't read
- everyone loves pictures
- reherse demo and be sure it works
- personally I like to see actual code. Not all of it, jsut a line or two,
  elegantly explained. Not screen-shots, actual code
- don't answer everything in the preso, let them ask!
- the fewer slides the better (more time for demo, code etc.)
