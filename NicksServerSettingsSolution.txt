I had to add the following:

1. In the template.yml Globals section:

Api:
    Cors:
      AllowMethods: "'GET,POST,OPTIONS'"
      AllowHeaders: "'content-type'"
      AllowOrigin: "'*'"
      AllowCredentials: "'*'"

2. In the Lambda function where the response is created add the cors
headers:

const response = {
        headers: {
          "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*", // Required for CORS support
to work
          "Access-Control-Allow-Credentials": true // Required for cookies,
authorization headers with HTTPS
        },
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify(body)
      };

That's it.

I then created a super simple HTML snippet using fetch and it worked fine:

   let newAlbum = {
            "artist": "Yaeow",
            "album_id": "10",
            "price": 12.99,
            "tracks": 11,
            "title": "I Need U"
        };

        fetch('https://tg1kms3jh8.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Prod',
{
            method: "POST",
            body: JSON.stringify(newAlbum),
            headers: {"Content-type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8"}
        })
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(json => console.log(json))
        .catch(err => console.log(err));
