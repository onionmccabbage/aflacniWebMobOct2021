Review Exercise
=============== see https://pastebin.com/93JDmKeS
until about 4:45

Start a fresh Angular project with routing and css
(decide on a suitable name, e.g. 'review1')
OR... for some of you, just go with what already works!!!

Use a comand window to generate two fresh modules
ng g c users
ng g c login

In the login component
- in the TS file, declare model for fname, lname and pword
- bind these values onto the HTML template
- also provide a button which changes the password to something else (pre-set)
  (you will need an event handler)
In the users components
- in the TS declare a model with several users e.g. an array of objects (like our items)
- in the HTML iterate to show the fname, lname and pword values
Optional (if time)
- write some CSS in each compoent to style the html
- e.g. choose a font, color, background-color 
- maybe set the headings color
- add a footer component with legal text (i.e. courier)



We need to ask the user for....
And then show....
Architect using components
